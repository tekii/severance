# tekii/severance — the Severance workflow experiment's home repo

This repo runs a **plain single-session lane** (mostly Claude Code web):
no container, no role split, no consumer machinery (DESIGN.md,
constraint 2). Safety is **boundaries, not severance**: commit or tag
only when the user prompts it; never push without an explicit ask.

## Sources vs artifacts (the release discipline)

- The small `*.md` **source files are the truth**. `SEVERANCE.md` and
  `RECORD.md` are **built** from them per `MANIFEST` by `make release`
  — **never hand-edit the artifacts.**
- Artifacts are rebuilt and committed **only in release commits** (the
  tagged commits): edit sources → set `VERSION` → `make release` →
  commit `release vX.Y.Z: …` → `git tag -a vX.Y.Z`.
- `make check` proves the committed artifacts equal a fresh rebuild.
  It MUST pass at every release commit. Between releases, source-only
  commits may leave it reporting DRIFT (sources ahead of artifacts —
  expected mid-cycle; say so in the commit message).

## Probe before proposing

Before authoring or proposing any change, probe the current
authoritative state: `git status -sb` + `git log` (fresh — not your
session-start snapshot), read the actual target files, and check
in-flight work (`gh pr list`, pending artifacts). Memory, instructions,
and snapshots are *hypotheses about* state — the probe is the only
source of "is". Name what you checked, so the proposal is verifiable.
(Register Entry 8; a web session once PR'd a file this repo already
had.)

## Before any commit

- Run `make check`; a failure must be either fixed or the known
  mid-cycle DRIFT, never a hand-edited artifact.
- Path hygiene (conventions/no-user-specific-paths.md) — both empty:
  `git grep -iE '/(home|Users)/[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+/'` and
  `git grep -i '<your-login>'`.
- Attribution (conventions/git-commit-attribution.md): AI mentions use
  `Assisted-By:` — **never `Co-Authored-By:`**; some harness defaults
  append it automatically — strip it.

## Dependencies

GNU Make + POSIX shell only. Do not add dependencies.

## The law here is cargo, not law

`constitution.md` and `conventions/` are **sources** of the law that
binds *consumer* projects' sessions (episode branches, Refiners, the
consumer's test gate). Here the law is text you maintain: this repo
is the vendor, has no `profile.md`, and commits on `master` by Devon's
ruling — "the gate" here means `make check`, not a consumer's test
suite. The one piece of the machinery this repo does keep is
`episodes/`: its own briefs and findings, by the episodes convention. Rules this repo **does** self-apply: attribution and
path hygiene (above), the learnings-register discipline (the register
lives here), trace-notes thinking for design-bearing removals (via
NOTES.md/DESIGN.md), and the conceit's anti-overstretch + casing rules
in all prose.

**No cast roles in attribution.** In prose the cast is the workflow's
(Devon, Mark, Refiners); in this repo the user is simply the user and
a session is simply a session. `Assisted-By:` lines name the
**model**, never a cast role — write
`Assisted-By: Claude (claude-<model-id>)`. (Historical commits signed
"(Outie, …)" date from the extraction period, when the first
consumer's outer session doubled as this repo's maintainer — an
artifact of that period, not a pattern to follow.)

## Orientation

[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) — packaging & release design (read first).
[conceit.md](conceit.md) — the naming metaphor. [constitution.md](constitution.md)
+ [conventions/](conventions/) — the binding law's sources.
[profile-contract.md](profile-contract.md) — what every consumer answers.
[learnings.md](learnings.md) — the experiment's register. [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)
— open items. [reintegration.md](reintegration.md) — the migration
record; [severed-era.md](severed-era.md) — the retired mechanics;
[episodes/](episodes/index.md) — this repo's briefs and findings.
Cast: **Devon** = the user, **Mark** = the main session across
sessions, **Refiners** = spawned agents.
