# SEVERANCE (SPEC) — the Unsevered workflow

**Severance** is a workflow for running AI coding-agent sessions
against one shared repository, across time and across lanes, without
any of them trampling the others or the truth. Its second form,
**Unsevered**, rests on one idea: every session ends and the next one
wakes with no memory of it, so **the repo carries the continuity** —
every unit of work leaves a brief, findings and commits that the next
session reads first. Work happens in **episodes**: Devon approves a
plan; the plan becomes a brief; Refiners implement on a branch; Mark
runs the gate and obtains a review; Devon authorizes; Mark integrates
with a plain merge. This document is the **binding law**; a consumer
project obeys it plus its own `profile.md` (see "The profile
contract", last section). The law is agent-vendor-neutral: it assumes
only sessions that read a repo, hold private memory, load configured
context, and can spawn agents — it has been used with Claude Code and
Antigravity.

This artifact is generated — do not edit it; edit the sources in the
Severance repo and re-release. Links in it are absolute by law: it is
read from vendored locations where repo-relative paths are dead.

## The cast (working vocabulary — used throughout this law)

| Name | Is | Descriptive form (also valid) |
|---|---|---|
| **Devon** | the user — the sole authorizer | "the user" |
| **Mark** | the main session, as one worker across sessions and lanes | "the main session" |
| **Refiners** | agents a session spawns (worktree implementers, read-only reviewers, probes) | "agents" |
| **tapes** | the single-author files of an episode: the **brief** and the **findings** | "the episode's files" |
| **episode** | one unit of asked work: brief → branch → gate → review → merge | "a unit of work" |

Casing rule: docs and agent-directed text always write the cast names
capitalized; lowercase forms are accepted only when Devon types them —
never write them back. The names' story, and the anti-overstretch
principle governing them, live in the RECORD — the companion
narrative artifact, `RECORD.md` (`conceit.md` upstream) — law here,
lore there. Generic names used in this law's examples:
**Lumon** = the generic company, **Cold Harbor** = the generic consumer
project (doc-only terms; they never name a real filesystem path).

## Adoption, in brief

1. Vendor this file into your repo (commit the copy; its `version`
   frontmatter is your pin; update = replace file, diff, commit).
2. Write `profile.md` beside it answering the profile contract —
   including one entry per lane you work in.
3. Load this file into every session's context via each harness's
   auto-loaded configuration (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`); keep the
   RECORD out of session context — it is for humans.
4. Create `episodes/` at the repo root with an `index.md` (episodes
   convention). On any checkout worked on locally, set the harness to
   branch Refiners from the local HEAD (Claude Code:
   `worktree.baseRef: "head"`), or push before spawning — by default
   they branch from the remote and cannot see unpushed commits.
